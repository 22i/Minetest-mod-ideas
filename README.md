Post your ideas under issues and if some idea was already implemented give a link.

# QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVMENTS:

-When you create new world its name is randomly generated unless changed in settings

-Random  funny mesages on start and loading

-Autospacebar moves you up a block automaticly

-bow can be used even when arrows are in inventory

-Toolbar swapping for survival
If you click Shift 1-3 the toolbar should swap to that row in your inventory. This way you help builders in survival also.

-When watching minetest videos on youtube you could at any point in the video click on a button which opens up minetest with that world subgame mods time and situation as video you were watching

-Time machine
World backs up every night and you can craft a time machine to go back to a previous day.
This would be capped at 7 days so world files were not too big. Recipe would be expensive, probably including a nether star.

-Coordinates on map item suggestion
As the title says: maps should have x,y,z coordiantes in the right up corner to show the player the point where he was the last time. How it could work is that the point/dot/red X should show on the map when right clicking it on a block to select the area you would like to remeber. Works 1 time per map, otherwise it would be too OP using it every time ;)

# MOBS:

-ability to sacrifice mobs to get mob specific powers

-ability to kick mobs in the but which propels them far away based on your kick level

-mobs spawn with armour

-option for mobs to change into other mobs during day or night
This would be helpfull for werewolf like mobs at day they are npc like friendly at night they turn into aggressive werewolfs. When day starts they turn back to human and cycle continues.

-Add A Spawn Egg that spawns an entity that can be cuztomize
the entity should look like from the education edition of Minecraft and it can make maps look more cooler

-Mobs that drain your speed

-Killer rabbits are created when a rabbit is struck by lightning

-Mob that akwardly falls over and you need to help him to get back up

-LAWYER DROPS FUNNY CASSES OF WEIRD LAWSUITS

-Minetest civilization mod with goal of singularity

-Mob that walks backwards

-Captcha mob it can only be defeated by entering the correct captcha

-All knowing mob that you can ask questions and he will answer you

-Mob that spawns next to you and harasses you when you sit idle for too long: those lazy ass welfare queens dont do nuthin eith thenself

-Right clicking on an entity while holding a command block allows you to edit that entity's NBT.
When an op'd player in creative mode right clicks on a mob or other entity while holding a command block, it should open a GUI which lets them edit that entity's NBT values.

-Slimes change in size as they absorb items
By absorbing, I really mean Pick up. If a Small slime were to pick up say... 5 items, it'd grow to the next size. If a medium sized slime were to pick up about 20 items, it'd grow to the largest size.

-Jack o laterns / pumpkins should scare away animals to protect your nice garden.
As said in the title, it would look nice when you place a pumpkin on a fence. It scares away animals (like sheep) that are eating your grass and/or destroying your nice farm. It could maybe work with some mobs too like scaring away endermans or something.

# NEW FEATURES

-Snow and wool should reduce fall damage, like hay.
Considering in 1.9 Hay bales, now reduce 80% of damage when falling in them, many other soft blocks were forgotten :/
Also, Snow and wool should do the same... Those are very soft blocks in the real world (so is hay) and falling into snow, would cushion your fall, same as if you fell on wool, this would be nice for parkour, maps, or if you fell out of your ice castle, you wont die of fall damage!
Landing on end rods and single iron bars, increase fall damage.
Hay bales already decrease damage taken by fall damage, so why not have some blocks that increase fall damage? This would be a fresh mechanic the game has never seen before in vanilla.

-Custom blocks
A new item called paint buckets can be crafted by surrounding a bucket with the colored dye you want the paint to be. There is also a plain white block called a: canvas block, and when you right click it you can use paint buckets to paint the new block pixel by pixel or make all sides identical!

-TNT should be a bit more unstable and dangerous
Unstable TNT Blocks -TNT should have a 1/100 chance (or something like that) of exploding when a player lands on it from 3 blocks or higher.
Hidden/Forgotten TNT Blocks -There should be hidden unstable TNT blocks found underground in many places (mostly mineshafts and strongholds) which make a small hissing sound every 2-3 minutes, and if the block itself or a block that is is touching is broken without a golden/diamond pickaxe, then it will explode!

-Mining fatigue after some time you wont be able to mine anymore till next day

-You get nausea if you don't sleep for 10 days.

-When you sleep there is a rare chance that you get teleported to a dream world.
The dream world would look like the Overworld but the shader would have a tiny bit more more saturation. If you build something and then leave the area, the thing you built would disappear. You would wake up when you die in the dream world.

-Christmass crackers

-Getting hit by a minecart at high speeds inflicts damage It should be at the maximum of 2.5 hearts. When you get killed by the minecart, it shows the death message "player got ran over by minecart". Also when you get hit by a TNT minecart, it will blow up immediately (only at max speed).
It would only make sense. Any Ideas?

-shooting stars! This would just be a small, simple change and would add a nice little aesthetic to the game. These would happen on random occurrences. One or two could fly by during the night for players to spot.

-multiplayer mod making and live preview in server

-Magma blocks should surround natural lava sources
I know part of the fun not fun! of tunneling underground or in the nether is running into random lava lakes and almost dying, but I think magma should surround the lava as it could give more variety to the underground and the nether, and since in-game magma is a mixture of rock and lava, it would make a nice transition. And it would give a warning to players before they accidentally burn themselves to death.

-Double-Jump Enchantment for boots?
Each time you use double jump, it deals a small amount of damage to your boots to give it a balance, and of course, if you wanted it to last longer, you can use the protection enchant.
To make sure this feature doesn't get exploited so players can avoid fall-damage, double-jumping will only reduce your fall damage by one heart, since you lose 1 heart per meter you fall as listed here: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Damage#Fall_damage
This should also be compatible with the jump-boost affect, so if your jump boost effect lets you jump 5 meters, double jumping lets you jump another 5 meters equaling 10.
I feel these features would do well for parkour and adventure maps since double-jump is a really popular and useful mechanic.

-a tool that helps you - tells you what to do.

-Make rivers more realistic, with watersheds, waterfalls, etc. This would be supported by the infiniteY (infinite up and down), because mountains could start high up and the river could flow down to sea level.

-Do something similar to the http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1294958-no-cubes-1-0-realistic-graphics

-World regeneration: Trees spread. When a sapling falls on the ground and is not picked up withing a minute it will plant itself. Also, mobs breed on their own, if their population in a certain area is low.

-Random recipes each generated world

-Jukebox music and ambient music shouldn't play at the same time

-Pixel text and formspecs

-Shadows

-The main menu, inventory, and other formspecs

-Ingame, there should be more help - and F1 should be the help-key.
And some pre-defined help-topics, that come up depending on the state of the user, eg.
* tool selected --> tools-page, explain what left/right-click do
* block/building stuff selected --> build/place-page
* pointing --> show page about that block
* inventory / chest / crafting --> explain moving stuff, link to crafting-guide
* furnace --> link to crafting-guide
* chat --> "/help"
* dark --> explain day/night, and torches
* general --> status of map (mapgen, server/multiplayer ...)
...
Also F1 while help is showing --> help-index

-This mod introduces a new danger into the game. a deadly trivia game. Once every minute a question and 4 or more answers will be displayed in you hud this will not pause the game.

you will need to press the correct key for the answer in 15 second time limit to answer it.

If the answer is wrong you will receive 3 hearts of damage and a book with question explanations so that you are ready for the next time the same question appears.

If the answer to a question is correct that particular question will not be appearing again. Once all the answers of that starter group are complete you get a choice between three further trivia themes. and the trivia continues

Questions that you get will be either random or set in order depending on your settings. 

There will be trivia dungeons that you encounter around the world they will consist of unbreakable blocks that turn breakable once you complete the dungeon. In those you will not be getting trivia each minute. Each room will have one question with 4 doors. if you open the correct door you can continue but if you open the wrong one you get 3 hearts of damage and 1 mob spawns.
